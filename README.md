Financial Products Explained
Financial products are tools that help people manage their money in different ways. They come in many forms and are designed to help with saving, borrowing, investing, protecting, and planning for the future.

Here's a breakdown of the most common types of financial products:

1. Saving
Purpose: To keep money safe and let it grow a little over time.
Example: A savings account where you can store money securely and earn a small amount of interest.
2. Borrowing
Purpose: To get money now and pay it back over time, usually with some interest.
Example: Loans like a car loan or a mortgage for buying a house.
3. Investing
Purpose: To grow your money by putting it into something valuable, like a business. There’s potential to earn more, but also a risk of loss.
Example: Stocks or mutual funds, where you own a part of a company and benefit if it does well.
4. Insurance
Purpose: To protect against unexpected costs, like medical bills or car repairs. You pay a little regularly, and the insurance helps you cover big costs if something goes wrong.
Example: Health insurance helps pay medical bills if you get sick.
5. Planning for the Future
Purpose: To save money for big expenses in the future, like retirement (when you stop working).
Example: Retirement accounts let you save money to support yourself when you’re older.
